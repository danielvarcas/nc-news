## NC News

A 'Reddit-clone' social news site built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Users can read articles and comments posted by other users or login to post their own. Articles belong to topics, which users can create if the topic does not already exist on the site. Users are also able to delete their own articles and comments. The app is designed to be used on varying screen sizes.
